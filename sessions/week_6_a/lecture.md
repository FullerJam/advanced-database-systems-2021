:::tip introduction

This week, we are going to complete CRUD operations.

Recall, [in week-4](https://social-annotations-development.web.app/week-4), we looked how to (R)ead and (D)elete data. This week, we will be completing the CRUD acronym by looking at (U)pdate.

We will be addressing the key question:

**How can I add/update data to a MongoDB database whilst maintaining data consistency?**

We will answer the above question by firstly thinking about what it means for data to be consistent. Next, we will move on to complete the create and update operations with the idea of data consistency in mind.
