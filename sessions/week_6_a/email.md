**subject:** Advanced Database Systems - Week 6 (Introduction)

Hello [:firstname:],

Welcome to Week Six.

This week we will be completing the (U) pdate in CRUD. Boom, just like that, you can all create, update and read from a MONGODB database. 

Further to the above, we wil also be considering the essential idea of database consistency and the concept of ACID compliance. 

[Please ensure you watch the lecture before the practical](https://joeappleton18.github.io/advanced-database-systems-2021/sessions/week_6_a/lecture.html).


All the best,
