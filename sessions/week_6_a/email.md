**subject:** Advanced Database Systems - Week 6 (Introduction)

Hello [:firstname:],

Welcome to Week Six.

This week we will be completing the (U) pdate in CRUD. Boom, just like that, you can all create, update and read from a MongoDB database.

Further to the above, we will also be considering the essential idea of database consistency and the concept of ACID compliance.

Please ensure you watch the lecture before the practical.

All the best,

Joe
