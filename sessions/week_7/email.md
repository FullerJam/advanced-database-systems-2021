**subject:** Advanced Database Systems - Week 8 (Introduction)

Hello [:firstname:],

Welcome to Week Eight.

This week we are going to consider how we can manage users in our wine tasting application. We ill frame this exploration through the following questions:

#### How can I allow users to register and securely login to my wines database?

- How can I manage users so they remain logged in between sessions?
- How can I allow users to enter a password, while keeping this password hidden from my application?

All the best,

Joe
