**subject:** Advanced Database Systems - Week 7 (Introduction)

Hello [:firstname:],

Welcome to Week Seven.

This week promises to address, that perhaps nagging, question:

How can we construct relationships when working with non-relational databases?

You'll learn, that non-relational does not mean no-relations, that would be very sad ðŸ˜¿. We'll also take the opportunity to look at some more advanced MongoDB queries. In doing so, we'll be able to dynamically populate the statistics on our wine tasting home page.

Further to the above, we will also look at how we can use MongoDB's aggregation pipeline to ask interesting questions of our data.

[Please ensure you watch the lecture before the practical.](https://joeappleton18.github.io/advanced-database-systems-2021/sessions/week_7/lecture.html)

All the best,

Joe
