This week promises to address, that perhaps nagging,  question: 

**How can we construct relationships when working with non-relational databases?**

You'll learn, that non-relational does not mean no-relations, that would be very sad ðŸ˜¿. We'll also take the opportunity to look at some more advanced MongoDB queries. In doing so, we'll be able to dynamically populate the statistics on our wine tasting home page.
