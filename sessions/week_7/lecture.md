This week I want to focus the reading and discussion on a series of [blog articles by](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/6-rules-of-thumb-for-mongodb-schema-design-part-1) William Zola, MongoDB's technical support engineer.

This week promises to address, that perhaps nagging, question:

**How can we construct relationships when working with non-relational databases?**

You'll learn, that non-relational does not mean no-relations, that would be very sad ðŸ˜¿. We'll also take the opportunity to look at some more advanced MongoDB queries. In doing so, we'll be able to dynamically populate the statistics on our wine tasting home page.
