Last week we considered how we could use NodeJS and the packages Express and ejs to construct the view layer of a data driven application. This week we will be continuing our journey by moving on to explore, the powers of the MongoDB data model.

[To assist us in gaining a better understanding of the powers of MongoDB, we are going to revisit our wine tasting dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews).

For those of you that have explored this data set you would have observed some interesting properties. First, there are around 20k tastings with no attributed taster. Second, although there are ~130k records, there are only ~20 wine tasters - they've been busy! Observations such as this can be helpful in determining the utility of a data set.
