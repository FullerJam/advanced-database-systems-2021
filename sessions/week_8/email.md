**subject:** Advanced Database Systems - Week 8 (Introduction)

Hello [:firstname:],

Welcome to Week Eight.

So far, we have been creating new tastings/tasters without attributing them to a user. In reality, a user should probably login before they can post to our database. This week we are going to address this point by answering the following question and sub questions:

#### How can I allow users to register and securely login to my wines database?

[Please ensure you watch the lecture before the practical.](https://joeappleton18.github.io/advanced-database-systems-2021/sessions/week_8/lecture.html)

All the best,

Joe
