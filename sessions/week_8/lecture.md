So far, we have been creating new tastings/tasters without attributing them to a user. In reality, a user should probably login before they can post to our database. This week we are going to address this point by answering the following question and sub questions:

#### How can I allow users to register and securely login to my wines database?

- How can I manage users so they remain logged in between sessions?
- How can I allow users to enter a password, while keeping this password hidden from my application?

In addressing the above questions, we are going to consider simple user authentication. We will not cover ideas such as multiple user roles (e.g. super-admin, admin, users). **You should note,** I don't expect you to use multiple role for your assessment. However, you may well acknowledge that in the future multiple roles will be required. Moreover, I do not expect you to use a sophisticated and highly secure authentication process.
