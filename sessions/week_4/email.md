**subject:** Advanced Database Systems - Week 3 (Introduction)

Hello [:firstname:],

Welcome to Week Three.

I am very excited about this week as we will be tying together everything we have learnt so far. In doing so, we are going to be exploring how we can construct **a model** layer to our application. Thus completing our MCV stack.

Please ensure you watch the lecture before the practical.

All the best,
	
Joe
