### How can I deploy my data-driven web applications to a secure and scalable infrastructure?

Deploying a web application used to be a slow and painful process. You would have to physically provision multiple servers (staging and production) and then use a protocol like FTP or SSH to upload changes and patches to our codebase. The issue with this approach, due to its cumbersome nature, deployments may happen infrequently. To live up to the agile manifesto of fast iterations and quick deployments we need a more versatile solution, and this solution comes in the form of a serverless infrastructures and cloud hosting.
